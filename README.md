A portfolio of projects that I've worked on relating to data science and machine learning.

## [Video Game Review Summarization](https://github.com/daniel-m777/Video_Game_Review_Summarization)
In this project, we combine the tasks of text classification, text summarization, and text-to-speech into one final implementation for users to quickly understand videogame reviews. Our focus was on IGN videogame reviews, such as this one. Our work involved heavy text cleaning, such as normalization via lowercasing, stopword removal, punctuation removal, and POS tagging. Below, we can get an idea of how each component worked and how we worked with our data.
